Hi, if you haven't figured it out yet my name is Dee.

Growing up, I had multiple different career choices and ideas. Like becoming a cheese specialist. I had dreams. I was determined. I had the will. However, after realizing how limited options were to pursue a career in the craft of cheese, I then altered my career path and found my niche in UI/UX Design.

I'm a self-motivated designer, infrequent caffeine consumer, avid internet surfer and pasta connoisseur. I'm an Ottawa native, with years of design education and freelance experience.
